for loop,
iterate frmo i, 0 to 3
	j = i
	httpcall
	callback, print j

print last number 3 times, 33333

http call is asynchronous, its about closures, 

for loop goes much faster than the asynchrnous calls

for loop i to 3
	function (code)
	return call

what is a scope? in angularJS
print the nth level of a binary tree.

need to practice DFS, BFS.
